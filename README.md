Welcome to Regreso for Raycast. This README primarily serves to help other developers setup, run, and collaborate the Regreso Raycast extension!

## üí¨ Introduction

Ever find yourself wanting to come back to an article, video, link, or manual at a later time but never actually doing it? (Regreso might be for you!) Or find yourself constantly having to launch the Regreso web [platform](https://regreso.netlify.app) every time you stumble across something amazing?

### ü§î What's the Solution?

This extension (obviously) but why?

1. Raycast is a super epic MacOS/Windows app that allows you to quickly execute commands to do things like launch apps, find files, perform simple calculations, translate text, etc from the comfort of a conveniently-shortcutted command palette.
2. This extension gives you the added power of **saving links and richly-formatted notes you wish to return to later**. Additionally, with planned features not supported on the Regreso platform (such as drafts and browser integration), this extension will become an important platform client.

### üí™ Example Use Cases

- You somehow ended up with a boatload of tabs generated during a niche rabbit-hole research session on a variety of topics and need to quickly organize them all into maps and workspaces for future reference.
- You use multiple machines (or browsers) regularly and want to be able to access your saved resources across browsers or (without) a browser at all.

## üöÄ Getting Started

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is only tested on Windows but should work cross-platform. Feel free to try on MacOS and if you encounter any problems, file an issue!

To get started with this extension, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository** to your device using `git clone https://github.com/matmanna/raycasting.git` and **cd into it**: `cd raycasting`
2. **Run install script**: `npm install`, then **run the development script**: `npm run dev` (once it's successfully running, feel free to press `Ctrl+C` or close the terminal window)
3. **Open Raycast** like usual (`alt+space` maybe?) and **search for "Settings"**. In the Regreso settings menu (from the left sidebar), **fill in your account credentials** (you can create one by signing up with email/password [here](https://regreso.netlify.app/sign-up)) and **close settings**.
4. **Start using Regreso for Raycast!** You can use the commands described below or search "regreso" globally in Raycast.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Commands

A list of the current commands available in the extension:

- Create Destination
- List Destinations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The following configuration preferences can be set:

- Instance URL (optional), **Default: https://regreso.netlify.app**: If self-hosting Regreso, enter your instance's web address here.
- Email (mandatory): If using session id auth, just write something random in this field.
- Password (mandatory): : If using session id auth, just write something random in this field.
- Session ID (optional) Optional but overrides email/password fields in favor of a statically-provided session ID
- AI Tagging: Disabled by default which will be used to generate destination tags.
- AI Instance: Defaults to `https://ai.hackclub.com`; If AI tagging is enabled, this URL will be used to send auto-tagging requests. (future authentication config will be available)

## üêõ Bugs and Features

If you find a bug with Regreso itself, file it under the main repo's [issues](https://github.com/matmanna/Regreso). Otherwise, for client-specific problems or suggestions, create an issue on this repository!
