Welcome to Regreso for Raycast. This README primarily serves to help other developers setup, run, and collaborate the Regreso Raycast extension!

## üí¨ Introduction

Ever find yourself wanting to come back to an article, video, link, or manual at a later time but never actually doing it? (Regreso might be for you!) Or find yourself constantly having to launch the Regreso web [platform](https://regreso.netlify.app) every time you stumble across something amazing?

### ü§î What's the Solution?

This extension (obviously) but why? First off, Raycast is a super epic MacOS/Windows app that allows you to quickly execute commands to do things like launch apps, find files, perform simple calculations, translate text, etc from the comfort of a conveniently-shortcutted command palette. But this extension gives you the added power of **saving your links and richly-formatted notes**. Additionally, with planned features not supported on the Regreso platform (such as drafts), this extension will hopefully become an important platform client.

### üí™ Example Use Cases

- You somehow ended up with 50 tabs generated from some niche rabbit-hole research on a topic and need to quickly organize them all into maps and workspaces.
- You use multiple machines regularly and want to be able to access your saved resources across browsers or (without) a browser at all.

## üöÄ Usage

To run this extension, simply:

1. Clone this repository to your device using `git clone`, navigate (`cd`) into it, and run the `npm run dev` script,
2. Launch Raycast like usual (alt+space maybe?) and search for "Settings". Inside of the Regreso settings menu (from the sidebar), fill in your regreso account credentials (you can create one by signing up with email/password [here](https://regreso.netlify.app/sign-up)) and close settings.
4. Start using Regreso for Raycast! You can use the commands described below or search "regreso" globally in Raycast.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### üìù A note about auth

The most complicated thing about the Regreso Raycast extension is the need for secure, simple authentication. Because the extension doesn't just serve as an RSS-feed-reader but enables mutational procedures as well, caution is important.
